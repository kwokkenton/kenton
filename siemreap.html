        <h2>A CAS Trip to Cambodia</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">December 2017</p>
        <p class="lead">Cambodia is a vibrant gem filled with a unique history and mesmerising culture. We have learned about different aspects of the Cambodian lifestyle, most notably embracing rurality, nature and Buddhist spirituality.</p>
        <p>Most of their people can be found in villages, and unfortunately deep in the claws of poverty too. They have limited access to luxurious commodities, a hygienic environment and also technology. This inextricably instilled shock in our metropolitan, Hong Kong-centric minds.</p>
        <p>According to Mr Vuhtta- our beloved tour guide, Cambodia is the poorest
          country in southeast Asia. It was difficult to accept that the country
          once flourished in intellect and trade during 900-1300AD-- the Angkor
          period. The Khmer kingdom thrived. Monarchs built Angkor Wat, literally
          ‘the city of temples.’ Intricate though faded carvings decorated the
          grandeur of the complex. Quite the manifestation of the country’s long
          foregone prosperity. </p>
        <p>Cambodia stumbled back into poverty because of many reasons-- namely the collateral damage of the Vietnam war and the Khmer Rouge that started in 1975. Led by radical Pol Pot, the Communist party aimed to revert the country back into primitive agricultural communes. They bloodily murdered intellectuals. Fewer and fewer people understood how to keep the economy running, making Cambodia less and less developed. Visiting the killing fields was all very poignant. Death was almost tangible in the air. Most of us were lost for words. Now the regime is over, Cambodia has the highest rate of corruption in southeast Asia. All of these factors contribute to how Cambodia is suffering right now in the world.</p>
        <p>Locals were passionate in greeting us, as tourists. If you looked around,
          you would see smiles glistening all around you. Despite their past and their limited natural resources, it is remarkable that Cambodians still remain really happy, optimistic and thankful of what they own and what they possess in life. In an area where clean water is a major concern, it is unimaginable how decadent qualities like ‘democracy’ are in their context. This taught us how should we be more grateful for the things we have in life. </p>
        <p>Throughout this trip, we experienced blistering heat and poor living environment (in our context) in the village, which had just introduced electricity 2 years prior to our visit. Still, many of the people would not use electricity as it is way too expensive for them. This shows how poor the people are in these countries, with so called ‘basic needs’ left unsatisfied. </p>

        <p>The activities we did as a group were diverse, including trekking,
          biking, swimming under a waterfall, games of football with the children, teaching and many more, deeply engraved into our hearts. We worked hard and played hard together. The trip undoubtedly was challenging but rewarding at the same time. Often times, experiences demanded cooperation and support, bonding us individuals closer together than ever.</p>
        <p>We hope that people can give more attention to developing countries like this and to help them if needed. We hope that Cambodia will recover from the damage inflicted by the past. We hope that people like us who live in a privileged environment could help give something back to people in need. It’s a relief to see NGO’s and ecotourism based firms in Siem Reap progressively aiding the betterment of Cambodia. </p>
        <p>As mere students from a secondary school in Hong Kong, all we could do was donate supplies for the village’s classrooms. This CAS trip enlightened us, made us more culturally sensitive and showed how a country like Cambodia should be revered and respected by the world. Hopefully, we will see this in our lifetimes.</p>
        <p>Thank you អរគុណ</p>
