        <h2>A trip to Rome</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">September 2019</p>
        <p class="lead"> Rome is where western civilisation budded and bloomed. Legend says that Rome began with a story of betrayal between two brothers, Romulus and Remus in ~750 BC. How a small village atop of the river Tiber and seven hills became one of the most powerful empires in the world is still much debated by historians (see SPQR by Mary Beard). Military conquests expanded its sphere of influence as far as Britain to the west and in the Iran to the east. Aside from spatial dominance, Rome leaves its legacy in political, infrastructural and cultural aspects until present day. </p>
        <p>To the present day tourist, Rome's uniqueness effervesces first from its ancient classical beauty in the form of architectural sights, ruins and art and second from its drool-inducing food scene. This precisely led six Imperial students to visit the Italian city in the first month of 2020.</p>
        <p>I left for the airport in a rather cinematic fashion (with some tight cuts and thumping cinematic music). After my labs ended at 5pm at Blackett, I paced back to my room in Beit and replaced my usual backpack load of books and stationery with thick clothes and toiletries. We then hurried to Gatwick airport, after a quick bite of Halloumi. </p>
        <p>Even though we were travelling during the supposed low season, the January plane was still packed to the brim, with some rowdy holiday-doers (such as us) and Italians just wanting the quickest route back to peace and quiet back home. As we landed in Italian territory at midnight, we too discovered that we required rest, and so we did at our traditional Italian Airbnb. </p>

As we landed in Italian territory at midnight, we too discovered that we required rest, and so we did at our traditional Italian Airbnb. </p>
        <p>We paced along the cobbled avenues, rushed by the chilly breeze in our faces. The Roman buildings on either side of us glowed under the burgeoning beams of sun, radiating a gentle sense of countering warmth as they have done for centuries on end. Arches, pillars and domes came into our view as we walked, each deservingly revered at by us. Seeing the Altare della Patria (Altar of the Fatherland) was a surprise. Stood before us was a national monument, a gargantuan marble construct with fountains on either side, a portico supported by a colonnade and domineering statues all round. The symbols were as expressive as they could get, each alluding to specific events that enshrine Italian glory and traditional splendour. No surprise that this monument has been used as a backdrop for numerous commemorations. </p>
        <p>As we turned the corner, the Colosseum rose into our view in its two-thousand year old splendour [Was definitely a WOW moment]. The Flavian oval-shaped amphitheatre, built as a series of superposed arcades was used for gladiatorial events and entertainment for the public. Though badly damaged by earthquakes, resulting in an obvious missing 'jigsaw piece' on the side, it's still the personified face of Rome, or Italy, for your average tourist. Also, it turned out that the myth was true and we successfully entered the Colosseum without much of a hassle, which allowed us to slowly walk through a short exhibition about the structure's history, architecture and archaeological progress. Moving in towards the tiers of seating, we peered down at the expansive arena, almost feeling the chilling palpitations induced by the imagined reverberations of cheers and jeers. The Colosseum isn't only a relic of history, but it is a living storybook now capable of making visitors swoon after making an impression, like an emblem of the ancient city itself. </p>
        <p>Next to the Colosseum was the Roman Forum, or what remained of what used to be the centre of Roman life. The Forum was a curious excursion as we found that our twenty-first century eyes were much incompatible with the structures with inconspicuous significance. The stubs of columns and foundations on the ground desperately called for an interpreter of the pastâ€” a guide to help us decipher the embodiments of the elusive past. </p>
        <p>Especially in European cities with a historical centre, the essence of getting an authentic perspective of the of the scene is to walk around and stumble about the stone paved lanes. After an invigorating cup of coffee, we strolled around the city beside the kind presence of small cars and scooters (Vespas) on a walking tour. En route, we sauntered around attractionsâ€” the Campidoglio square designed by Michelangelo , Palazzo Valentini then Piazza Navona which we will return to. </p>
        <p>Before that, we delved into the beauty of the second major Roman experienceâ€” a gastronomical adventure. Based on my YouTube-based expertise, I learned that Italian cuisine anchors rich flavours on simplicity. Cheesy, creamy, silky, savoury rigatoni was my dish. You could see each flavour on the plate, no pompous concealment or pretentious additions, the basic ingredients led to the best pasta I have ever had. The homemade, tomatoey, rustic and revolting pizza formed the basis of some other's lunch, again, simple yet delicious. After that we went to grab a GROM ice cream by Piazza Navona and savoured this cone-based delight by La Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers).</p>

        <p>We rounded up our night with a wine-paired dinner at a cozy local restaurant. </p>
