        The Allure of Salzburg
      </h2>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p> We ventured into the baroque city of Salzburg, unknowing that it will be named the top city to travel to by
        Lonely Planet in just one month— though it is evident that its natural allure needs no affirmation.
        Packed with a burst of culture,
        Salzburg is a quaint place that every soul must visit once in a lifetime.
      </p>

      <p> I visited the city along with my parents and it turned out to be quite a memorable farewell trip
        before I headed into university.
      </p>

      <p> As we stepped into the Altstadt (meaning 'old town'), the UNESCO protected historic city centre,
        it felt almost impossible not to feel lovestruck by the cosy cobbled streets and the rustic yet
        colourful buildings.We look up and see, just next to the bold display of the Austrian flag, a building painted a striking yellow— 'Mozarts Geburtshaus.' Individuals and groups from all over the world flock to 'Mozart's city' to view the birthplace of the single greatest composer who blessed the world with his musical talent. Now a museum, everyone can look at the artefacts and envision the stories that excited and troubled Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's life.
      </p>

      <p> Mozart is almost worshipped in Salzburg. As we pranced by Mozartsteg (bridge) onto
        Mozartplatz  (plaza), we couldn't help but notice the plethora of Mozart themed
        souvenirs on the street next to the tall monument of Mozart. The same portrait of
        a stern man with fine curled-up white hair in an iconic red coat adorns the postcards,
        keychains and specifically on the wrapper of a famed round pistachio-marzipan chocolate nougat
        called Mozartkugel.
      </p>

      <p> Other than the apparent Mozartfever, another 'cult' exists in Salzburg that is almost equally as prominent
        in the city. In 1964, filming of one of the loveliest musicals detailing (and adapting) the story of the von
        Trapp family singers— 'the Sound of Music'. 'Do re mi' was set in the lush gardens of the Mirabell palace
        amongst the line of red, white and pink roses meandering towards the central fountain. The gardens
        look even more majestic aligned with the historic backdrop of the fortress and church buildings
        and the panoramic mountain range. If you're a diehard fan (basically my dad) would like to set your
        memories in stone, consider joining the Sound of Music tour. You'll be joined by people who adore the
        film in and out to the churches, towns and lakes where the movie was set. If you're lucky, you'll get an
        injection of euphoria when the whole group does a karaoke on the whole playlist of the film.
      </p>

      <p> Salzburg literally means 'Salt Fortress,' which highlights how the salt trade brought prosperity
        to the city and culminated into the construction of the Hohensalzburg fortress in 1077.
        The fortress is a must-go, as you'll get a bird's eye view of the city in all its glory.
        Salzburg was independent until 1805 where it was annexed into the Austrian Empire, which
        as a result gave a unique flair to its Austrian culture. Our visit coincided with St. Rupert's Fair,
        a tradition since the 14th century that brings beer halls, market food and folk music to the city.
        Men and women of all ages wearing lederhosen and dirndl (traditional clothing) graced the town with their
        presence and contributed to the irresistible festive atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p> We sampled local Austrian cuisine, most notably the schnitzel,
      which are pieces of perfectly fried breaded meat served with a slice of lemon.
      The crunchy exterior coating contrasts with the juicy and tender interior which all
      gets enlivened by the subtle acid of lemon juice. For the perfect concluding note, try
      apfelstrudel, sweet cinnamon-dusted apples wrapped in a delicious layered pastry with a
      portion of fresh cream on the side. During the day, also sample the pretzels and hot dogs around the city.
      </p>

      <p> With the mindset of cramming in the most sights as possible,
        we also visited the nearby Untersberg mountains and took a cable car up to
        peer into the other side of the German-Austrian border. Feeling adventurous, we also took a
        day trip to the famous village of Hallstatt. The lake settlement felt like it came straight out of a
        fairy tale. This village was so popular to the extent that a replica was built in Guangdong, China.
      </p>

      <p> Be it music, architecture, food or culture, Salzburg has it all. One would think that visiting Austria's capital city Vienna is enough, but you would have only gained a small glimpse of the wealth of culture the country offers. As I finish this with Mozart's 'Marriage of Figaro' playing on my laptop, I find myself not only remembering the sights and experiences I had while travelling, not only the false sense of coincidental achievement I had as we visited Salzburg before a guidebook company gave it the title of 'Best in travel,' but also the people I travelled with— now some 6000 miles away.
